            {"Alright, team Criszel here, reporting a code red situation: I've somehow managed to misplace the golden ticket – my PSITS requirement sheet.",
            "Panic level? 11 out of 10. It's that serious.",
            "Hey party people! I'm Criszel, your guide through this twisted maze of lost paperwork and impending disaster. ",
            "Picture this: me, frantically tearing through every corner of my life, and the PSITS sheet is pulling a ninja vanish on me. Classic.",
            "I've checked under cushions, inside cereal boxes, and even behind my collection of commemorative rubber duckies.",
            "But hold on to your hats, because here's the plot twist: I've heard rumors of a magical portal at the end of this wild journey.",
            "A portal to the past! I know, I know – it sounds like the plot of a B-list sci-fi movie, but desperate times call for desperate measures.",
            "I'm left with no choice but to embark on this cosmic quest for a piece of paper. Yes, my life is that exciting.",
            "So, here's the deal: I need your mad skills and your good vibes to help me get to that portal..",
            "Will we make it? Who knows? But one thing's for sure – this adventure is about to get wild. So, buckle up, my friends!",
            "We're on a sheet-rescue mission, and nothing's gonna stand in our way. To the portal and whatever awaits us on the other side!",
            "By the way.. In this platformer, my character and water have an agreement...",
            "I don't swim, and water doesn't try to turn me into an accidental deep-sea explorer. It's a one-sided deal, really.",
            "P.S.... Press P if you ever get stuck in a block. The developer didn't how to fix it anyways."},

            //SCENE 2
            {"",
            "Alright, friends, here's the lowdown. Up ahead, you'll encounter some tricky foes, fiery spirits that turn this platformer into a real nail-biter.",
            "Just wanted to give you a heads-up before we dive into the action.",
            "These fiery adversaries mean business, and one misstep, and well, you know the drill.",
            "Sure, I could try the classic 'avoid them' tactic, but these aren't your average enemies. ",
            "They call this place home, and I'll need some careful moves to navigate through without getting singed.",
            "Buckle up, and let's hope the game physics are on my side today."},

            //SCENE 3
            {"",
            "Well, well, look who's about to rewrite history – me! And you, my trusty audience.",
            "Who would have thought our quest for a misplaced piece of paper would lead us to this dramatic moment?",
            "Shakespeare would be proud, or confused. Probably both.",
            "Behold, the portal! A swirling mix of ones and zeros, the VIP entrance to the good old days.",
            "They say it can transport lost items and desperate adventurers.",
            "So, naturally, I'm expecting a red carpet and maybe a welcome committee of nostalgic memes.",
            "Now, before we dive headfirst into this pixelated rollercoaster, let's take a moment.",
            "A moment to appreciate the sheer absurdity of this quest. A quest for a sheet of paper.",
            "I mean, couldn't my life have a more glamorous plot twist? Maybe a secret spy mission or discovering buried treasure?",
            "And you, my invisible companions, I owe you a debt of gratitude. The real MVPs in my pixelated escapades.",
            "May your pixels always shine bright, and your Wi-Fi connection be forever stable.",
            "Now, brace yourselves, because in a moment, we're stepping into the unknown.",
            "Or maybe just last Tuesday. Time is relative, after all."},
